Pseudocode:
	Process fasta into one string
	Iterate through each position of string
		In each position, create substrings of length 1 to length of big string - position (i.e. from position to end)
		Check if is each is a palindrome
Strategy:
	Can work on individual modules instead of trying to tackle all problem at once
